# BillionPasswordList

I came to the realization that we occasionally need to break passwords that we have lost, thus I created a billion passwords for you. I combined online wordlists as well. Additionally, I divided the 16GB file into a 1GB file with 15 cycles. Python is used for the splitting code. It will only launch file explorer. A location where you wish your divided files to be stored should be present, along with your.txt file.
